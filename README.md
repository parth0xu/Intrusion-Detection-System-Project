# 🚀 Secure Network Monitoring & Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with Snort

## 🔥 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **network security monitoring system** using **Snort**, an open-source **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**. It helps detect and log malicious activities in a network and generates alerts for potential cyber threats.
See IDS Snort Project.pdf 

## 📌 Features
✅ **Real-time network traffic monitoring**  
✅ **Custom Snort rules for threat detection**  
✅ **Integration with ELK Stack for visualization**  
✅ **Simulation of cyber attacks using Nmap & Metasploit**  
✅ **Log analysis for incident response**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Snort** – Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- **Wireshark** – Packet Analyzer
- **Nmap** – Network Scanning Tool
- **Metasploit** – Penetration Testing
- **Kibana/ELK Stack** – Log Analysis & Visualization
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)** – Server for running Snort

## 🎯 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Install Snort
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y snort
```

### 2️⃣ Configure Snort
Edit the Snort configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

### 3️⃣ Run Snort in IDS Mode
```bash
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```

### 4️⃣ Simulate an Attack with Nmap
```bash
nmap -sS -p 22 192.168.1.1
```

### 5️⃣ View Alerts
```bash
cat /var/log/snort/alert
```

## 📊 Visualizing Logs with ELK Stack
1. Install and configure the ELK Stack.
2. Use **Logstash** to forward Snort logs.
3. Analyze data with **Kibana dashboards**.

## ⚡ Future Enhancements
- Implement **machine learning for anomaly detection**.
- Automate incident response with **SOAR tools**.
- Integrate with **firewalls & SIEM platforms**.
